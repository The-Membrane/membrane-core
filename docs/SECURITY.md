## Reporting a Bug
Security is something we take seriously at Membrane. Thanks for taking the time to improve the security of `membrane-core`. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report security bugs by emailing Membrane at membranefi@gmail.com. Do not report it publicly on the GitHub issues tracker. Your report should detail the necessary steps to reproduce the security issue. We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and send a detailed response indicating the next steps. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy
If we receive a security bug report, we assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:
* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find any potentially similar problems.
* Rollout the fixes.
